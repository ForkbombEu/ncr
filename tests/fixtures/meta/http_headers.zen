Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'request' in 'http_headers'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'http_headers'
When I verify 'content-type' is found in 'request'

When I create the 'string dictionary' named 'headers_reponse'
and I set 'Content-Type' to 'application/json' as 'string'
and I move 'Content-Type' in 'headers_reponse'
and I set 'Cache-Control' to 'no-store' as 'string'
and I move 'Cache-Control' in 'headers_reponse'
and I move 'headers_reponse' to 'response' in 'http_headers'

Then print 'content-type' from 'request'
and print the 'http_headers'
