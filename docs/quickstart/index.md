# ðŸŽ® Quick start

No Code Room (NCR) is a server designed to execute Zencode scripts seamlessly. With ncr, you can quickly set up endpoints
based on Zencode files and serve static files with minimal configuration. Itâ€™s perfect for projects utilizing
Zencode logic with a need for an accessible HTTP interface.


To start using ncr, run the following commands:

```bash
# download the binary
wget https://github.com/forkbombeu/ncr/releases/latest/download/ncr -O ~/.local/bin/ncr && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ncr

# checkout this repo
git clone https://github.com/forkbombeu/ncr

# run the server with the example folder
ncr -p 3000 -z ./ncr/tests/fixtures --public-directory ./ncr/public
```

Now, open http://localhost:3000/docs in your browser. You will see a list of all available endpoints, which correspond
to the Zencode files in the ./tests/fixtures folder. Additionally, static files in the ./public directory will be
accessible, for example, http://localhost:3000/file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3.

For customizing ncr's behavior, check out the [Configuration section](./conf).

Moreover ncr comes with an easy way to:
* check for valid input with [json schema](./../info/schema)
* run automatically some setup contracts with the [.autorun folder](./../info/autorun)
* set more information about the API with a [metadata file](./../info/metadata)
